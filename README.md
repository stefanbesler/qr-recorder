# QR Recorder

Simple web app to link QR codes to audio files. The idea is pretty straightforward: record some audio, print the QR code as a sticker, and stick it in a photo album.  

Whenever someone flips through the album, they can scan the QR code and listen to the recording.  

It’s basically a way to add little voice notes or memories to your photos.
